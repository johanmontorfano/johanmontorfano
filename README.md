# Hi! I'm Johan 
[johanmontorfano.com](https://johanmontorfano.com)

I’m Johan, a developer and systems thinker working at the intersection of software architecture and ethics.

My work spans from low-level systems programming to data science and decentralized infrastructure.  
Whether building an operating system or rethinking how we value data, I aim to design tools that reflect complexity without exploiting it.

This profile isn’t just a collection of code. It’s a reflection of the ideas I explore about the systems we use and trust.

## 🔧 Current Projects

### 🧠 Commonrift
A decentralized framework for **ethical data valuation** and **data ownership**.  
It pools user-consented data, anonymizes and aggregates it into structured datasets, and leverages probabilistic modeling, k-anonymization, graph networks, and blockchain-backed valuation.

> This project leverages an academic-proof system of virtual ownership which is under active development

- Context-aware data structuring (TGN, GraphSAGE, BERT/HMM)
- Bayesian and sales-based valuation models
- Privacy-preserving mechanisms (aggregation, k-anon)
- Blockchain interoperability and dataset marketplaces

### 🪐 JDOS
[Repository](https://github.com/johanmontorfano/jdos)

A minimalist x86_64 operating system written from scratch.  
Built with a clean userspace/kernelspace separation. Ring 3 for dreams. Ring 0 for steel.

- Custom `linker.ld` with separated ELF segments for usermode/kernel
- Inline libc, syscalls, FAT8 support
- Colored shell, app support, stdin/stdout/stderr architecture

### 🌀 JOOGLE
[Repository](https://github.com/johanmontorfano/joogle)

JOOGLE is a Rust-powered search engine, built on the premise that anyone can do a search engine.  

- Supports page indexing, robots.txt, sitemaps(.xml or .tar.gz)
- Uses both SSR with Maud or SPA built with Solid.js
- Has a search console with search and indexing analytic

## 📬 Contact / Collaboration

I’m currently open to:
