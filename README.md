# Hi! I'm Johan 

Iâ€™m Johan, a developer and decentralization enthusiast working on making the Web better.

My work spans from low-level systems programming to full-stack apps and decentralized infrastructure.  
Whether building an operating system or rethinking how we value data, I aim to design tools that reflect complexity without exploiting it.
